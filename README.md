# Monty Interpreter

Monty is an interpreter made based on the C programming language to manage stacks and queues. This interpreter interpretes Monty bytecodes files (ideally with the .m extension). More info about Monty here http://montyscoconut.github.io/

```
$ make
```

## The following are the allowable opcodes and their functionality:

|pall  |print every member of the structure|
| pint | prints the member value at the top of stack |
| swap | swaps the order  of the 1st and 2nd elements in stack |
| add | add top two member values |
| sub | subtract the top element from the 2nd top element |
| div | divide the 2nd element by the top element |
| mul | multiply the top two elements of the stack |
| mod | the remainder when the 2nd element is divided by the top element |
| comment | there is the ability to parse comments found in bytecode ->'#'|
| pchar | print character at the top of the stack |
| pstr | print the character at the top of the stack|
| rotl | moves element at the top to the bottom of the stack |
| rotr | the bottom of the stack becomes the top |

| nop | opcode should do nothing |
